# Coding-knowledge-quiz
Welcome to my coding quiz assignment!!
My first step is to create a new repository in my Github.
Once that is completed my next step was to clone it to my computer.
Using Gitbash I cloned it to my computer.
Next I opened VS Code and can start my code. 
First I start with the head creating my css link and creating the title of the site "JavaScript Quiz"
Next came the header which I created div tag for my timer.
Once that was completed I start on the main section where it tells the user what to expect once they click Start Quiz button.
The remaining of the assignment is taking place in JavaScript where i will create the generating quiz with time function.
Once my JavaScript got completed I pushed my finish assignment on GitHub repository using gitbash.
Using gitt -A / git commit -m / git push.
Once in my repository I went to setting, pages, and created my deployed site.
The final step was to submit it to my Bootcamp with my repository URL and Deployed URL.
Deployed URL: https://jmizis.github.io/Coding-knowledge-quiz/
