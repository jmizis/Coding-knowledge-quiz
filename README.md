# Coding-knowledge-quiz
Welcome to my coding quiz assignment!!
My first step is to create a new repository in my Github.
Once that is completed my next step was to clone it to my computer.
Using Gitbash I cloned it to my computer.
Next I opened VS Code and can start my code. 
First I start with the head creating my css link and creating the title of the site "JavaScript Quiz"
Next came the header which I created two div tags, "View High Score", "Time:".
